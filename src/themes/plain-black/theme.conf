# A plain theme for the rEFInd boot menu
#

# Normally, when the timeout period has passed, rEFInd boots the
# default_selection. If the following option is uncommented, though,
# rEFInd will instead attempt to shut down the computer.
# CAUTION: MANY COMPUTERS WILL INSTEAD HANG OR REBOOT! Macs and more
# recent UEFI-based PCs are most likely to work with this feature.
# Default value is true
#
#shutdown_after_timeout

# Whether to store rEFInd's rEFInd-specific variables in NVRAM (1, true,
# or on) or in files in the "vars" subdirectory of rEFInd's directory on
# disk (0, false, or off). Using NVRAM works well with most computers;
# however, it increases wear on the motherboard's NVRAM, and if the EFI
# is buggy or the NVRAM is old and worn out, it may not work at all.
# Storing variables on disk is a viable alternative in such cases, or
# if you want to minimize wear and tear on the NVRAM; however, it won't
# work if rEFInd is stored on a filesystem that's read-only to the EFI
# (such as an HFS+ volume), and it increases the risk of filesystem
# damage. Note that this option affects ONLY rEFInd's own variables,
# such as the PreviousBoot, HiddenTags, HiddenTools, and HiddenLegacy
# variables. It does NOT affect Secure Boot or other non-rEFInd
# variables.
# Default is true
#
#use_nvram false

# Screen saver timeout; the screen blanks after the specified number of
# seconds with no keyboard input. The screen returns after most keypresses
# (unfortunately, not including modifier keys such as Shift, Control, Alt,
# or Option). Setting a value of "-1" causes rEFInd to start up with its
# screen saver active. The default is 0, which disables the screen saver.
#
#screensaver 300

# Hide user interface elements for personal preference or to increase
# security:
#  banner      - the rEFInd title banner (built-in or loaded via "banner")
#  label       - boot option text label in the menu
#  singleuser  - remove the submenu options to boot macOS in single-user
#                or verbose modes; affects ONLY macOS
#  safemode    - remove the submenu option to boot macOS in "safe mode"
#  hwtest      - the submenu option to run Apple's hardware test
#  arrows      - scroll arrows on the OS selection tag line
#  hints       - brief command summary in the menu
#  editor      - the options editor (+, F2, or Insert on boot options menu)
#  badges      - device-type badges for boot options
#  all         - all of the above
# Default is none of these (all elements active)
#
hideui hints, arrows

# Set the name of a subdirectory in which icons are stored. Icons must
# have the same names they have in the standard directory. The directory
# name is specified relative to the main rEFInd binary's directory. If
# an icon can't be found in the specified directory, an attempt is made
# to load it from the default directory; thus, you can replace just some
# icons in your own directory and rely on the default for others.
# Icon files may be in any supported format -- ICNS (*.icns), BMP (*.bmp),
# PNG (*.png), or JPEG (*.jpg or *.jpeg); however, rEFInd's BMP and JPEG
# implementations do not support transparency, which is highly desirable
# in icons.
# Default is "icons".
#
#icons_dir icons/snowy
icons_dir themes/plain-black/icons

# Use a custom title banner instead of the rEFInd icon and name. The file
# path is relative to the directory where refind.efi is located. The color
# in the top left corner of the image is used as the background color
# for the menu screens. Currently uncompressed BMP images with color
# depths of 24, 8, 4 or 1 bits are supported, as well as PNG and JPEG
# images. (ICNS images can also be used, but ICNS has limitations that
# make it a poor choice for this purpose.) PNG and JPEG support is
# limited by the underlying libraries; some files, like progressive JPEGs,
# will not work.
#

# Specify how to handle banners that aren't exactly the same as the screen
# size:
#  noscale     - Crop if too big, show with border if too small
#  fillscreen  - Fill the screen
# Default is noscale
#
banner_scale fillscreen

# Icon sizes. All icons are square, so just one value is specified. The
# big icons are used for OS selectors in the first row and the small
# icons are used for tools on the second row. Drive-type badges are 1/4
# the size of the big icons. Legal values are 32 and above. If the icon
# files do not hold icons of the proper size, the icons are scaled to
# the specified size. The default values are 48 and 128 for small and
# big icons, respectively.
#
#small_icon_size 96
big_icon_size 128

# Custom images for the selection background. There is a big one (144 x 144)
# for the OS icons, and a small one (64 x 64) for the function icons in the
# second row. If only a small image is given, that one is also used for
# the big icons by stretching it in the middle. If only a big one is given,
# the built-in default will be used for the small icons. If an image other
# than the optimal size is specified, it will be scaled in a way that may
# be ugly.
#
# Like the banner option above, these options take a filename of an
# uncompressed BMP, PNG, JPEG, or ICNS image file with a color depth of
# 24, 8, 4, or 1 bits. The PNG or ICNS format is required if you need
# transparency support (to let you "see through" to a full-screen banner).

# Set the font to be used for all textual displays in graphics mode.
# For best results, the font must be a PNG file with alpha channel
# transparency. It must contain ASCII characters 32-126 (space through
# tilde), inclusive, plus a glyph to be displayed in place of characters
# outside of this range, for a total of 96 glyphs. Only monospaced fonts
# are supported. Fonts may be of any size, although large fonts can
# produce display irregularities.
# The default is rEFInd's built-in font, Luxi Mono Regular 12 point.
#
#font myfont.png

# Use text mode only. When enabled, this option forces rEFInd into text mode.
# Passing this option a "0" value causes graphics mode to be used. Pasing
# it no value or any non-0 value causes text mode to be used.
# Default is to use graphics mode.
#
#textonly

# Set the EFI text mode to be used for textual displays. This option
# takes a single digit that refers to a mode number. Mode 0 is normally
# 80x25, 1 is sometimes 80x50, and higher numbers are system-specific
# modes. Mode 1024 is a special code that tells rEFInd to not set the
# text mode; it uses whatever was in use when the program was launched.
# If you specify an invalid mode, rEFInd pauses during boot to inform
# you of valid modes.
# CAUTION: On VirtualBox, and perhaps on some real computers, specifying
# a text mode and uncommenting the "textonly" option while NOT specifying
# a resolution can result in an unusable display in the booted OS.
# Default is 1024 (no change)
#
#textmode 2

# Set the screen's video resolution. Pass this option either:
#  * two values, corresponding to the X and Y resolutions
#  * one value, corresponding to a GOP (UEFI) video mode
# Note that not all resolutions are supported. On UEFI systems, passing
# an incorrect value results in a message being shown on the screen to
# that effect, along with a list of supported modes. On EFI 1.x systems
# (e.g., Macintoshes), setting an incorrect mode silently fails. On both
# types of systems, setting an incorrect resolution results in the default
# resolution being used. A resolution of 1024x768 usually works, but higher
# values often don't.
# Default is "0 0" (use the system default resolution, usually 800x600).
#
#resolution 1024 768
#resolution 1440 900
#resolution 3

# Enable touch screen support. If active, this feature enables use of
# touch screen controls (as on tablets). Note, however, that not all
# tablets' EFIs provide the necessary underlying support, so this
# feature may not work for you. If it does work, you should be able
# to launch an OS or tool by touching it. In a submenu, touching
# anywhere launches the currently-selection item; there is, at present,
# no way to select a specific submenu item. This feature is mutually
# exclusive with the enable_mouse feature. If both are uncommented,
# the one read most recently takes precedence.
#
#enable_touch

# Enable mouse support. If active, this feature enables use of the
# computer's mouse. Note, however, that not all computers' EFIs
# provide the necessary underlying support, so this feature may not
# work for you. If it does work, you should be able to launch an
# OS or tool by clicking it with the mouse pointer. This feature
# is mutually exclusive with the enable_touch feature. If both
# are uncommented, the one read most recently takes precedence.
#
#enable_mouse

# Size of the mouse pointer, in pixels, per side.
# Default is 16
#
#mouse_size

# Speed of mouse tracking. Higher numbers equate to faster
# mouse movement. This option requires that enable_mouse be
# uncommented.
# Legal values are between 1 and 32. Default is 4.
#
#mouse_speed 8

# Launch specified OSes in graphics mode. By default, rEFInd switches
# to text mode and displays basic pre-launch information when launching
# all OSes except macOS. Using graphics mode can produce a more seamless
# transition, but displays no information, which can make matters
# difficult if you must debug a problem. Also, on at least one known
# computer, using graphics mode prevents a crash when using the Linux
# kernel's EFI stub loader. You can specify an empty list to boot all
# OSes in text mode.
# Valid options:
#   osx     - macOS
#   linux   - A Linux kernel with EFI stub loader
#   elilo   - The ELILO boot loader
#   grub    - The GRUB (Legacy or 2) boot loader
#   windows - Microsoft Windows
# Default value: osx
#
use_graphics_for osx,linux,grub,windows

# Which non-bootloader tools to show on the tools line, and in what
# order to display them:
